##McCorkell and Associates website template

# Challenge - Render of a given website template

- Teachnologies used;
  - HTML & CSS
  - Node.js to setup build environment
  - Deployed via Heroku

- Approach: The main challenge was making the site responsive on mobile devices. Building with Bootstrap would have made this process easier, however I chose to use plain CSS to challenge myself. At this stage the site is around 80% responsive, with some kinks to be worked out when accessing on devices such as older iPhones models and iPad Pro devices.
